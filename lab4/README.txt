Building one-level:

The standard 'make' command will build the solution in the os folder and apps folder. But to run the tests, instead of using 'make run', I implemented 'make run1', 'make run2',... etc. As some of the tests end the execution on purpose. Use these run commands to run all of the required tests.

Building & running fork:

Normal make and make run commands.

Building and running heap:

Normal make and make run commands.
