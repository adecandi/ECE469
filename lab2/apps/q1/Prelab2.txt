(2 points) How is a semaphore created in DLXOS?

	The SemCreate function. It grabs a semaphore, initializes it and returns a handle to this semaphore.

(2 points) Explain how sem_signal and sem_wait work.

	The sem_wait function decrements the count of the semaphore and waits if the count is negative. The function fails if the semaphore is not initialized and valid, it then returns 1. 

	The sem_signal function increments the count of the semaphore and wakes up a process waiting on the semaphore. The function fails if the semaphore is not initialized and valid, it then returns 1. 

(2 points) What is a handle and how is it used to access semaphores in DLXOS?
	A handle is a paramter (an integer) and it is used as an index to access semaphores in DLXOS.
