LAB 5 Notes for Nadav

Ok here is where we are at. fdisk.c should be fully working. You can use the blockprint scripts in the scripts
folder to test them more, but they look perfect now. 

To test do a make clean in ostests, then fdisk, then os. Then make os, make fdisk, make run fdisk, make ostests,
then make run ostests.

This will have fdisk.c make a disk, and then run the ostests to test our functionality. Currently it looks like
we are stuck in DfsInodeWriteBytes. But that's where I left off. I was able to open a new inode and allocate it
fine. There was a number of changes here and there, but you can can keep going from there. If you want debug
statements use dbprintf with Q as the character code. That's what I have been using.
