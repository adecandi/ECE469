To build a solution enter into the os directory and enter the 'make' command, and then the apps folder you wish to run and run make. Then run 'make run' from this apps folder to run the solution.

Currently the example runs correctly, and the q2 is close to correct, but I am still having errors. prio_test also runs very close to correct, but not perfect.
